# Arkanoid

This project was coded as a five-part ongoing assignment on the 2nd semester of my 1st year at BIU. This project was coded using a single thread, which is rare for games such as this. Also, it uses no Java GUI Built-In objects, instead, I used a GUI implementation which is included in this repository.

# Compiling and Running
You must have Java SE 10 or higher installed on your machine. Also, you can download the entire source code and run the game via any Java IDE.

# The Goal
• Remove all blocks in each level by striking them with the ball

# The Game Rules
• You have only 5 lives, so use them carefully!

• You can get a little rest by pressing on the key 'p' - pause.

• Whenever you clear all the blocks on one level, you move to another, more challenging one.

• The score should carry on from level to level. If you finish the last level, you win the game.

• On level 3 and 4 there is two special blocks - adding/removing a ball.
